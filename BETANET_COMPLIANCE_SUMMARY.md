### ⭕ Higher Layer Requirements - OUT OF HTX L2 SCOPE

| # | Layer | Requirement | HTX Status |
|---|-------|-------------|------------|
| **5** | L1 Path | SCION bridge functionality, HTX-tunnelled transition | ⭕ **Not applicable** - L1 applications will use HTX |
| **7** | L3 Overlay | Bootstrap via rotating rendezvous IDs with BeaconSet + PoW | ⭕ **Not applicable** - Overlay applications will use HTX |
| **8** | L4 Privacy | Mixnode selection with BeaconSet randomness and path diversity | ⭕ **Not applicable** - Privacy layer will use HTX |
| **9** | L5 Naming | Alias ledger with finality-bound 2-of-3, Emergency Advance liveness | ⭕ **Not applicable** - Naming applications will use HTX |
| **10** | L6 Payments | 128-B Cashu vouchers with PoW adverts and Lightning settlement | ⭕ **Not applicable** - Payment applications will use HTX |
| **11** | L7 Governance | Anti-concentration caps, diversity and partition checks | ⭕ **Not applicable** - Governance applications will use HTX |
| **13** | Build Process | Reproducible builds with SLSA 3 provenance artifacts | 🔄 **Process enhancement** - CI/release pipeline |

## 🏗️ Betanet Architecture Compliance

### Layer Model Implementation Status

```
L7 | Applications                           ← Uses HTX
L6 | Payments (federated Cashu + Lightning) ← Uses HTX
L5 | Naming & trust                         ← Uses HTX
L4 | Optional privacy hop (Nym mixnet)      ← Uses HTX
L3 | Overlay mesh (libp2p-v2 object relay)  ← Uses HTX
L2 | Cover transport (HTX over TCP/QUIC)    ← ✅ HTX IMPLEMENTS THIS
L1 | Path selection & routing (SCION)       ← Uses HTX for tunneling
L0 | Access media (IP bearer networks)
```

**✅ Perfect Architectural Fit**: HTX correctly implements L2 and provides the foundation all higher layers depend on.
